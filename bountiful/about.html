            Bountiful Foods is small business specializing in organic, locally
            grown foods. They are physically located in Carlsbad, California,
            however, they have many food trucks that cover the coastal area from
            Los Angeles to San Diego. The company sells fruits and produce
            directly from the farmers in the area, but also uses some national
            and international suppliers. The owner-operated company caters to
            walk in traffic at their storefront in Carlsbad and, of course,
            their food trucks. They deliver and manage those orders on the phone
            and via the website. The mission is to provide fresh and healthy
            food options, including organic, made to order, fruit drinks and
            fruit bags, to the local population and to tourists visiting the
            coastal areas. The theme should support healthy eating, organic
            bounty, and convenience.
